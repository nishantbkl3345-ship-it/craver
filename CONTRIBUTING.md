Writing style guidelines
When contributing content, please follow these key principles from our style guide:

Clarity and simplicity: The goal of our writing style is clarity and simplicity.
Meaning over grammar: Grammatical correctness is important, but not as important as clarity and meaning.
Second person: The docs use second-person ("you") to communicate directly with readers.
Inclusive language: Use inclusive language by not assuming gender or ability level, and by avoiding slang and idioms.
Accessible technical language: Jargon is sometimes necessary, but don't assume every reader has your technical expertise.
Active voice: Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice means avoiding "be" verbs like "is" or "are" when you can, but also choosing more dynamic verbs to get your point across. "Press (a key)" is less dynamic than "tap (a key)," for example.
Clear terminology: Avoid technical abbreviations like "repo" and "PR," and Latin abbreviations like "i.e." and "e.g."
For complete style guidance, see our style guide.
